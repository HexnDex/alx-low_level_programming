**Recursion**
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem or perform a task. It's a powerful and elegant approach for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems. Recursive functions have two main components: a base case and a recursive case. The base case defines the termination condition, ensuring that the recursion eventually stops, while the recursive case breaks the problem down into smaller instances of the same problem.

**How to implement recursion**

1. **Define a base case:** This is the condition under which the recursion stops. When the base case is met, the function returns a result without making any more recursive calls.

2. **Define a recursive case:** In the recursive case, the function calls itself with modified arguments, moving towards the base case. The result of the recursive call is often combined with other calculations to obtain the final result.

3. **Make the recursive call:** Within the function, call itself with modified arguments to solve a smaller instance of the problem.

4. **Combine results:** In many cases, you'll need to combine the results from the recursive calls to obtain the final result.

5. **Ensure progress towards the base case:** The recursive call should be moving closer to the base case with each iteration to avoid infinite recursion.

**When to implement recursion**

- When the problem can be naturally divided into smaller, similar subproblems, and the solution to the problem can be expressed in terms of solutions to its subproblems (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci, and certain sorting and searching algorithms).

- When a recursive solution is more intuitive and easier to understand than an iterative one.

- When working with data structures like trees, graphs, and nested structures, where recursion can simplify traversal and manipulation.

- When the problem naturally follows a divide-and-conquer or recursive strategy, leading to more efficient solutions.

**When not to implement recursion**

- When solving the problem using an iterative approach is more efficient in terms of time and space complexity. Recursion can be less efficient due to the overhead of function calls and the potential for stack overflow errors.

- When the problem doesn't naturally break down into smaller subproblems or doesn't exhibit a recursive structure.

- When the depth of recursion is too deep, leading to stack overflow errors or excessive memory consumption. In such cases, an iterative approach or tail recursion might be more suitable.

- When code readability and maintainability are more critical, and a recursive solution might make the code overly complex and less understandable.

- When there's a strict memory constraint, as recursion can consume more memory than an iterative approach in some situations.

In summary, recursion is a valuable technique for solving certain types of problems but should be used judiciously, considering factors like efficiency, readability, and the nature of the problem you're trying to solve.
